## Overview
This detection use case identifies repeated failed SSH authentication attempts
against an Ubuntu endpoint monitored by Wazuh.

SSH brute-force attacks are a common initial access technique used by attackers
to gain unauthorized access to Linux systems by guessing credentials.

This detection helps SOC analysts quickly identify credential access attempts
and respond before successful compromise.
