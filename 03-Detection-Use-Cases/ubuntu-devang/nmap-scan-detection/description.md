# Nmap Network Scan Detection – Ubuntu (Devang)

## Overview
This detection use case identifies network reconnaissance activity performed
against an Ubuntu endpoint using Nmap scanning techniques.

Network scanning is commonly used by attackers during the reconnaissance phase
to discover open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities before launching
further attacks.

Detecting scanning activity at an early stage allows SOC teams to disrupt
attacker reconnaissance and reduce attack surface exposure.
