# Nmap Network Reconnaissance Detection – Aditya Endpoint

## Overview
This detection use case focuses on identifying network reconnaissance activity
performed against a Windows 10 endpoint using Nmap scanning techniques.

Attackers commonly use network scanning during the reconnaissance phase to
identify open ports, running services, and potential entry points before
launching further attacks.

Detecting reconnaissance at an early stage allows SOC teams to reduce attack
surface and proactively block malicious actors.
