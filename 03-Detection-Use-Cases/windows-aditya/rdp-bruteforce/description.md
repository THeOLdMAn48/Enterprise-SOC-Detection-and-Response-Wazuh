# RDP Brute Force Detection – Aditya Endpoint

## Overview
This detection use case identifies brute-force attempts targeting the
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service on a Windows 10 endpoint monitored
by Wazuh.

RDP brute-force attacks are commonly used by attackers to gain initial
access to Windows systems by guessing weak or reused credentials.

Early detection helps SOC teams prevent unauthorized access and
potential ransomware or lateral movement attacks.
