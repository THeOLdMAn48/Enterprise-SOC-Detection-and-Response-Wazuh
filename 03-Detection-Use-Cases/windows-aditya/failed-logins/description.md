# Windows Failed Login Detection – Aditya Endpoint

## Overview
This detection use case focuses on identifying repeated failed authentication

Multiple failed login attempts may indicate brute-force attacks, password
spraying, or unauthorized access attempts. Early detection allows SOC teams
to prevent credential compromise and further lateral movement.
