An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could perform relay attacks and make the users subject to elevation of privilege attacks.
The SMB Server already supports mechanisms for hardening against relay attacks:

SMB Server signing
SMB Server Extended Protection for Authentication (EPA)

Microsoft is releasing this CVE to provide customers with audit capabilities to help them to assess their environment and to identify any potential device or software incompatibility issues before deploying SMB Server hardening measures that protect against relay attacks.
If you have not already enabled SMB Server hardening measures, we advise customers to take the following actions to be protected from these relay attacks:

Assess your environment by utilizing the audit capabilities that we are exposing in the September 2025 security updates.  See Support for Audit Events to deploy SMB Server Hardening—SMB Server Signing &amp; SMB Server EPA.
Adopt appropriate SMB Server hardening measures.",High,CVE-2025-55234

As of July 8, 2025 Microsoft has completed mitigations to address this vulnerability. See KB5042562: Guidance for blocking rollback of virtualization-based security related updates and the Recommended Actions section of this CVE for guidance on how to protect your systems from this vulnerability.
An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Windows based systems supporting Virtualization Based Security (VBS), including a subset of Azure Virtual Machine SKUS. This vulnerability enables an attacker with administrator privileges to replace current versions of Windows system files with outdated versions. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could reintroduce previously mitigated vulnerabilities, circumvent some features of VBS, and exfiltrate data protected by VBS.
Update: July 10, 2025
Microsoft has addressed this vulnerability for Windows 10 1507, Windows 10, version 1607, Windows 10, version 1809, and Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2018. This ensures that mitigations are available to protect all supported versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11 from this vulnerability. See the available mitigations and deployment guidelines described in KB5042562: Guidance for blocking rollback of virtualization-based security related updates.
Update: August 13, 2024
Microsoft has released the August 2024 security updates that include an opt-in revocation policy mitigation to address this vulnerability. Customers running affected versions of Windows are encouraged to review KB5042562: Guidance for blocking rollback of virtualization-based security related updates to assess if this opt-in policy meets the needs of their environment before implementing this mitigation. There are risks associated with this mitigation that should be understood prior to applying it to your systems. Detailed information about these risks is also available in KB5042562.
Details:
A security researcher informed Microsoft of an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server 2016, and higher based systems including Azure Virtual Machines (VM) that support VBS. For more information on Windows versions and VM SKUs supporting VBS, reference: Virtualization-based Security (VBS) | Microsoft Learn.
