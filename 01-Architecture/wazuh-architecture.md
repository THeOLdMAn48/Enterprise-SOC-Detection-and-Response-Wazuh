# Wazuh Architecture

Wazuh follows a manager–agent architecture where endpoints forward logs
to a centralized manager for analysis and correlation.

## Components
- Wazuh Agent: Collects logs and security events
- Wazuh Manager: Processes and correlates events
- Dashboard: Visualization and alert analysis

This architecture enables scalable enterprise SOC deployments.
